This directory contains the various projects that make up the AdamMil.net
WebDAV server.
* Documentation - This project can be built using the Sandcastle Help File
  Builder (or Visual Studio if you have the SHFB plugin installed) to produce
  a .chm file containing the documentation for the server.
* Examples - This project contains a couple of example services built on top
  of the WebDAV server.
* Server - The WebDAV server itself.
* Tests - Unit tests for the WebDAV server. These tests can be run using NUnit
  or from the command using the built-in test runner.

In addition, the server relies on parts of the AdamMil.net library:
  AdamMil.Collections, AdamMil.IO, AdamMil.TestHelpers, and AdamMil.Utilities
These projects can be obtained from http://www.adammil.net/AdamMil.net
