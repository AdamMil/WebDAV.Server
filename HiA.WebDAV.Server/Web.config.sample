      <!-- The 'davLockManager' element configures the lock manager used for the WebDAV server. It should have a 'type' attribute set to
           the full type name of a class that implements the HiA.WebDAV.Server.ILockManager interface. The class must either have a public
           default constructor or a constructor that accepts a HiA.WebDAV.Server.Configuration.ParameterCollection (allowing additional
           configuration attributes to be processed by the lock manager). If the element is omitted, no default lock manager will be
           available, disabling locking for most services. These are the built-in lock managers:
           * HiA.WebDAV.Server.FileLockManager - A lock manager which stores the locks in a file on disk. It has these parameters:
             o lockFile      - The path to the file in which the locks will be saved.
             o revertToSelf  - Boolean. Determines whether the lock manager will revert to the process identity before opening the file on
                               disk. This allows the file to be opened with the IIS process account, which is usually more privileged.
                               The default is true.
             o writeInterval - Positive integer. The number of seconds to wait before flushing pending changes to disk. The default is 60
                               and the maximum is 2147483.
           * HiA.WebDAV.Server.MemoryLockManager - A lock manager which holds locks in memory while the service is running but does not
                                                   persist them to any permanent storage device.
           In addition to the manager-specific parameters mentioned above, all built-in lock managers support the following parameters:
           * defaultTimeout     - Nonnegative integer. The default lock timeout, in seconds, used when the client does not request a
                                  specific timeout. A value of zero means that locks do not time out by default. The default is zero.
           * maximumLocks       - Nonnegative integer. The maximum number of locks that can be active at any one time. A value of zero
                                  indicates that there is no limit. The default is zero.
           * maximumLocksPerUrl - Nonnegative integer. The maximum number of locks that can be active on a single URL. A value of zero
                                  indicates that there is no limit. The default is zero.
           * maximumTimeout     - Nonnegative integer. The maximum lock timeout, in seconds. A value of zero indicates that there is no
                                  maximum. The default is zero.

      <!-- The 'locations' collection defines the roots of WebDAV services within the URL space. -->
      <locations>
        <!-- A location is used to match request URIs against different WebDAV services. Multiple locations can match the same URI;
             the first matching location is used, even if the location is disabled. If the first matching location is disabled or no
             location matches a request URI, the request is ignored by the HiA.WebDAV service. This allows you to carve out a subtree from
             a WebDAV service that is excluded from WebDAV processing by adding a disabled location matching that subtree. Locations have
             the following attributes, all of which are optional except for 'match':
             * match     A string matching the request URI, of the form [[scheme://](hostname|IP)[:port]][/path/to/davroot/]
                         If the scheme portion is unspecified, the location matches any scheme. If a hostname is used, it must match the
                         host within the request URI; otherwise, if an IP is used, it must match the IP of the network interface
                         servicing the connection. If the port is unspecified, the location matches any port. If the entire authority
                         portion is unspecified, the location matches any authority. If the path is specified, it identifies the root of a
                         WebDAV service, and all URIs under that path are matched by the location; otherwise, it matches all paths. The
                         URI must be in its canonical form, with no unnecessarily escaped characters. The match attribute is required, and
                         must be unique among locations in the collection. If you want a match attribute value that matches all URIs,
                         use "/". Examples:
                           https://www.example.com:8080/webdav/  - matches HTTPS requests to www.example.com on port 8080 under /webdav/
                           www.example.com:8080/webdav/          - matches both HTTP and HTTPS requests
                           www.example.com/webdav/               - matches requests to any port
                           123.234.99.88/webdav/                 - matches requests serviced by the interface bound to 123.234.99.88
                           [2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334]/path/  - matches an IPv6 address
                           /webdav/                              - matches requests on any hostname, as long as the path is under /webdav/
                           www.example.com                       - matches all requests to www.example.com
             * enabled   If true (the default), the location will respond to WebDAV requests. If false, the location will ignore them, and
                         they will not be processed by other locations in the list.
             * type      The full type name of a class that implements the HiA.WebDAV.Server.IWebDAVService interface. The class must
                         either have a public default constructor or a constructor that accepts a
                         HiA.WebDAV.Server.Configuration.ParameterCollection (allowing additional configuration attributes to be processed
                         by the service). This attribute is required for enabled locations.
             * caseSensitive      If true, path matches (but not hostname matches) will be done case sensitively. If false, case will be
                                  ignored. The default is false.
             * serveRootOptions   If the service is enabled and this parameter is true, the service will be allowed to serve OPTIONS
                                  requests to the root of the server and to the "*" URL. This option is provided as a workaround for
                                  WebDAV clients that incorrectly submit OPTIONS requests to the root of the server. Using this option is
                                  not necessary if the 'match' attribute is such that the service would serve requests to the root anyway.
                                  If this option is enabled, the service must be prepared to handle URLs outside its scope.
                                  The default is false.
             * <other>   Attributes not listed above will be collected and passed to the HiA.WebDAV.Server.IWebDAVService instance as
                         parameters if it has a public constructor that accepts a HiA.WebDAV.Server.Configuration.ParameterCollection. Be
                         aware that attribute names are case-sensitive, so if you specify an attribute named "Match" it will be
                         interpreted as a custom attribute and not the required "match" attribute.
             The built-in WebDAV services are:
             * HiA.WebDAV.Server.FileSystemService - Serves files from the filesystem. Supports the following configuration attributes:
               o fsRoot   - Specifies the root within the filesystem from which files will be served. Effectively, this maps the service
                            root to the given filesystem root. If empty or omitted, all files on all drives will be served.
               o writable - Boolean. Determines whether the DAV service allows the creation, deletion, and modification of files and
                            directories. The default is false.
